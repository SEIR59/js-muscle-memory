/***********************************************************************
Write a function `countScores(people)` that takes in an array of score
objects (people) as its input. A score object has two key-value pairs:
a name (string) and a score (number). `countScores(people)` should
return an object that has key-value pairs where each name is a key and
the value is their total score.

Example 1

const ppl = [ 
    {name: "Pete", score: 10},
    {name: "Mike", score : 10},
    {name: "Pete", score: -8},
    {name: "Dexter", score: 12}
];

const countPpl = countScores(ppl);
countPpl; //=> { Pete: 2, Mike: 10, Dexter: 12 }

Example 2

*/const peeps = [
  {name: "Pete", score: 2},
  {name: "Dexter", score: 2},
  {name: "Mike", score: 2},
  {name: "Dexter", score: 2},
  {name: "Mike", score: 2},
  {name: "Pete", score: 2},
  {name: "Dexter", score: 2}
];
countScores(peeps); //=> { Pete: 4, Mike: 4, Dexter: 6 }


function countScores(people) {
  let obj = {}
  for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++){

    let one = people[i].name
    //let two =(people[i].score)
    if(obj[one]) {
      obj[one] += people[i].score
    }else{
     one = people[i].name
     two =people[i].score
     obj[one]= two

    }
    console.log(one, two)

  }
return obj;
}
